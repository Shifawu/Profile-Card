# Profile Card – HNG Internship Stage 0 Task

## 💡 Project Overview
This is my Stage 0 task for the "HNG Internship (Frontend Track)".  
The goal was to build a **responsive, accessible, and semantic profile card** using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (vanilla)** — no frameworks.

The profile card includes:
- User name  
- Short biography  
- My image  
- Current time in UTC  
- Social links (Twitter, GitHub, LinkedIn)  
- Hobbies list  
- Dislikes list  

🚀 Stage 1 – Extended Portfolio (Main Focus)

✨ Objective

To upgrade the Stage 0 profile card into a multi-section, responsive portfolio webpage that includes:

A navigation bar (with toggle menu for mobile view)

An About Me section

A Contact Me form

Enhanced layout structure, maintaining accessibility and responsiveness


🎨 Key Features

Responsive Navigation Bar – Horizontal on larger screens and collapsible on mobile

Smooth Scroll Navigation – Links connect to different sections on the same page

About Me Section – Shares background, goals, and growth mindset

Contact Me Form – Includes validation for name, email, subject, and message fields

Consistent Design Theme – Maintains the color scheme and concept from Stage 0

Accessibility Focus – Proper heading hierarchy, labels, and readable color contrast

Mobile Responsiveness – Optimized layout for all screen sizes

Each element follows the required `data-testid` attributes for automated testing.
