# Profile Card – HNG Internship Stage 0 Task

## 💡 Project Overview
This is my Stage 0 task for the "HNG Internship (Frontend Track)".  
The goal was to build a **responsive, accessible, and semantic profile card** using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (vanilla)** — no frameworks.

The profile card includes:
- User name  
- Short biography  
- My image  
- Current time in UTC  
- Social links (Twitter, GitHub, LinkedIn)  
- Hobbies list  
- Dislikes list  

Each element follows the required `data-testid` attributes for automated testing.


## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML5** (semantic structure)
- **CSS3** (Flexbox, responsive layout, gradient design)
- **JavaScript (ES6)** for displaying current time in milliseconds

## 📱 Features
- Responsive design (works on mobile, tablet, and desktop)
- Accessible markup and alt text for the image
- Hover and focus effects on social links
- Dynamic timestamp using `Date.now()`
